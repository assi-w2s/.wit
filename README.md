I've created a simplified demo system for git (wit) to show how a version control system works and how it can be used to manage and track changes to a codebase.
The demo wit system allows you to experiment with different Git commands and see how they affect the repository.
With the demo VCS, you can init the repository, create branches, make changes to the code, and merge the changes into the main branch.

The demo Git system is a simplified version of the real Git, but it provides a good introduction to how Git works and how it can be used in a development workflow.

Try out the demo Git system to get a feel for how version control works, and see how it can help you collaborate on a project with other developers.
